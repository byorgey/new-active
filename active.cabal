synopsis:            An EDSL for time-varying values.
description:         active is a small EDSL for building continuous,
                     time-varying values
                     of arbitrary type. It is particularly useful for
                     building media such as animations, audio clips,
                     and the like, but it is often useful to have
                     other values that vary over time (vectors,
                     colors, filters, volume levels...) and be able to
                     create and use them in the service of
                     constructing time-varying media.
